They slowly spread in the nearby islands and established many small settlements, loosely knit together by an aristocracy of barons. The archipelago as a whole was not very rich in food or mineral wealth, and soon the dwarves found themselves at odds for the little resources of the area. A few bloody wars were fought among them. They finally united when menacing creatures from undersea (maybe related to the Kerminhae, maybe not) appeared on many shores of the archipelago. With many efforts and losses the united dwarves managed to find a southern, relatively safe route to the coast (to Grawyz, in the Klagorst Confederacy) and established a supply line. By that time most dwarves were accustomed to the islands and decided to stay there. The archipelago's name, \"The Larodar Chain\", is a pun on the fact that the islands were actually a chain for the wanderers (\"Larodar\" in dwarvish tongue, see GAZ6). Even the capitol's name \"Murrak Ful\" comes from Mur-Hrak-Ful, which in dwarvish tongue means \"Chain of the western lake\" (see GAZ6 for dwarvish words, the original dwarves mistaking the ocean they were stranded into for a very large lake).", author: "LoZompatore, based on an idea by Giulio Caroletti", link: "http://pandius.com/klagregn.html"}},

In fact, it is only by virtue of the 500-man garrison here that the town remains a colony of Bellayne - otherwise it would have been abandoned to its own fate (there is a strong pro-imperialist faction in the Bellayne government that has managed to keep the troops here). Despite the military presence, Port Elsterbury is a free city for all intents and purposes, and anything can be traded here for a price, including slaves.

Protected on its three landward sides by high walls, and by a sea wall along the Sound, its residents feel quite safe. Many inhabitants make a living mining the nearby hills for copper, platinum, and rubies, which are in abundance here. Many other squander their earnings at the numerous pubs and gambling houses - the other pillars of the local economy - while some save up their earnings and build palatial estates outside the confines of the town. Many travellers find themselves here on their way to the Izondian Desert, or further south towards the source of the Sound. Along with Beira (number 16 on the map), this town forms half of the so-called \"Texeiran gate\" (or the Texeiran Noose, depending on your sympathies). Both of the towns are situated on either side of the entrance to the Adakkian Sound such that they can control access to it. The Texeiran grip on the area will be tightened further when the settlement of Torres Novas is established sometime around AC 1007. It will be located 2 hexes due north of Porto Santuário, and will allow the \"Gate\" to be closed firmly. So far, the Gate has enlarged Texeiran coffers considerably, as any ship wishing to enter the Sound in order to access the other ports and colonies along its shores must pay a tariff valued at 5% of the net worth of the goods carried on board, or face the wrath of the Texeiran Southern Fleet based in both Beira and Porto Santuário. What this amounts to is a tax on visiting one's colonial possessions deeper within the Sound, and for doing business in the region. Needless to say, the atmosphere is very tense, and it would not take much for hostilities to erupt. As it stands now, no one has yet discovered a safe overland route into the Sound, and no one yet can match Texeiran naval prowess in the region.

They did not get far, however, before a horde of lizard men, who had been wandering for centuries after the destruction of their homeland to the southwest, decided to move in and take control. Meeting with some rebellious Troglodytes, they encouraged thoughts of revolt, promising them freedom if they helped them conquer the town. Within weeks, the Troglodyte servants rose up against their masters, and slaughtered them, suffering great losses in the process. Unfortunately, the lizard men had no intention of giving the Troglodytes their freedom, and moved in and exterminated the weakened victors. Renaming the town Klath-T'zarth, the lizard men remade it to their liking, destroying the unpleasant obsidian buildings and replacing them with ones of more mundane stone. Since then, the population has grown slowly, eking out an existence from the surrounding lands and the nearby Bogs of Greth through fishing and primitive farming. Some money is also made by providing guides to lead travellers to half-sunken ruins (many of them Varellyan) scattered throughout the marshlands, and by hiring out warriors as mercenaries (as Vilaverde is doing in preparation for a war with Texeiras).

As Androkia grew into a mighty city, as well as a provincial capital, the local rulers gradually began to see themselves as the equals of their masters in Varellya proper. This pride and rivalry with the mainland was also a contributing factor to the civil war, and the genocidal policies pursued against the Oltec community was also driven by Androkia's leaders. The city's role as a crossroads of commerce and history ended with the fateful sack of Androkia in AC 207, which razed the city to its foundations. In AC 321, the surviving Varellyan inhabitants of Cestia decided to form their own nation once more, under the guidance of senior clerics of the various faiths practiced at that time. Androkia, as the former capital of the province, would be the capital of their land once more, but it was named \"Mogador\" - a means of severing ties with a past that was seen as decadent. Today, Mogador is growing slowly as a capital and port city, but compared to its ancient glory, it is but the merest shadow of its former self.", author: "Geoff Gander", link: "http://pandius.com/cestia.html"}}, // capital name not given

No less than five times was it unsuccessfully assaulted, and as a result it is among the few settlements that did not require extensive reconstruction. Today, it is once more a town of miners and farmers, supplying Androkia's coffers with gold and silver.

That golden era ended in AC 208, when the city fell to one of the warring ethnic Varellyan factions struggling to control southern Cestia, bringing Kart-Hadasht's 400 year history to an end. It was not until AC 373 that anyone returned to the city to resettle it, and even then Kart-Hadasht did not grow beyond being a coastal fishing village until AC 620. Today, Kart-Hadasht is once more a growing port. Much of the old city has been reclaimed from the wilderness, though many ancient suburbs and satellite villages remain forgotten. There is a bustling local market here, where passers-by can purchase many different kinds of freshly-caught fish, as well as locally-grown vegetables.

Nestled in jungle-cloaked hills, Tulear is almost impossible to see from above, carefully concealed as it is with foliage and camouflage measures, and buttressed by formidable walls. It was established circa AC 200, originally as the meeting place of local Oltec leaders. Frequent, and devastating, Night Dragon raids in that period forced the various clans of the region to band together in order to survive. To lead them through those tough times, a king was nominated to guide them, but over time that role became formalised, while the role of the individual clan leaders was reduced. It was then decided that Manakara should be a kingdom, with Tulear as its capital. Since then, Tulear has grown into a prosperous city, filled with artisans, smiths, weavers, leatherworkers, and miners from the nearby hills. Rich deposits of gold and rubies have added to the city's wealth, as well as made it a target for Androkian and Ambiroan raids.

During those years, Night Dragons plagued eastern Cestia, and in order to better disguise the city, its walls and were cleverly built to resemble natural cliffs and crags, and a great deal of plant cover was used as well. These precautions did not prevent invasion, however; in AC 715, an Ambiroan army punched through defences to conquer Ankavandra, which then endured a 40-year occupation.
