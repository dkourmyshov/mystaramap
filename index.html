Only a trickle of people ever came to this place, and these were often the outcasts of Bellayne society - derelicts, fugitives from justice, and the like. Travellers coming here will see what are obviously once-opulent palaces, manors, and public buildings being used as flophouses, taverns, and gambling halls. Truly an urban planning disaster. In fact, it is only by virtue of the 500-man garrison here that the town remains a colony of Bellayne - otherwise it would have been abandoned to its own fate (there is a strong pro-imperialist faction in the Bellayne government that has managed to keep the troops here). Despite the military presence, Port Elsterbury is a free city for all intents and purposes, and anything can be traded here for a price, including slaves. Lawfully-aligned adventurers would not wish to stay here long - the aura of social decay and malevolence is strong here - and any newcomer to this town who is not careful will be relieved of their valuables.

They named it Abb-H'zoth. By AC 400, the town was rapidly growing, and the Carnifex rulers began making plans to expand their holdings and drive out those of other races. They did not get far, however, before a horde of lizard men, who had been wandering for centuries after the destruction of their homeland to the southwest, decided to move in and take control. Meeting with some rebellious Troglodytes, they encouraged thoughts of revolt, promising them freedom if they helped them conquer the town. Within weeks, the Troglodyte servants rose up against their masters, and slaughtered them, suffering great losses in the process. Unfortunately, the lizard men had no intention of giving the Troglodytes their freedom, and moved in and exterminated the weakened victors. Renaming the town Klath-T'zarth, the lizard men remade it to their liking, destroying the unpleasant obsidian buildings and replacing them with ones of more mundane stone. Since then, the population has grown slowly, eking out an existence from the surrounding lands and the nearby Bogs of Greth through fishing and primitive farming. Some money is also made by providing guides to lead travellers to half-sunken ruins (many of them Varellyan) scattered throughout the marshlands, and by hiring out warriors as mercenaries (as Vilaverde is doing in preparation for a war with Texeiras). Apart from these activities, there is little contact with the outside world - few would want to come here, and the inhabitants do not want the interference of outsiders. Thus this town remains a mystery, which some enterprising merchants see as virgin territory for their goods. Adventurers would have little to do here, save for exploring the nearby ruins, and possibly learning about the now-forgotten deed against the Carnifex and their servants.", link: "http://pandius.com/adakkia.html"}},
